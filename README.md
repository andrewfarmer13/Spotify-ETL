# Spotify-ETL

The goal of this project was to first extract my spotify song data, secondly transform that data into a way that is easier to read, finallt load that data into an excel spreadsheet inorder to perform a more indepth analysis on the data. I was inspired to do this project by Spotify wrapped that comes out every year. I wanted to do an analysis on my listening habits and have a way to do this throughout the year.

## Technologies Used

- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) - provides access to Spotify user related data.
