# Spotify-ETL

The goal of this project was to first extract my spotify song data, secondly transform that data into a way that is easier to read, finallt load that data into an excel spreadsheet inorder to perform a more indepth analysis on the data. I was inspired to do this project by Spotify wrapped that comes out every year. I wanted to do an analysis on my listening habits and have a way to do this throughout the year.

## Technologies Used
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) - provides access to Spotify user related data.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a python module for data analysis and manipulation.

## Demo

## To-Do
1. Automate the analysis that is done in excel
2. Optimize the code
